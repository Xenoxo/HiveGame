Phase 1: Basic Hex movement
+ Build an app that allows a user to create and remove a hex
+ Clicking on the hex will show potential moves that are directly adjacent to the hex
+ Clicking on an adjacent hex will move the original hex

Phase 2: Standardize the Game components
+ Figure out if zooming in/out, scrolling is possible
+ Create the "default view" this would be the view that every game starts at
+ Define the "center" for this default view...if I generate a piece, it will always be at the center

Phase 3: UI Design
+ Standardize the hex pieces in size
+ Design the game board (including places to have the pieces)
	+ Use a simple UI GAME PIECE x 3, instead of implementing 3 objects
+ Make the first move always generate the piece in the middle

Phase 4: Add Rules for the Game
+ Give player ability to click on a reserve piece and spaw it
+ Subsequent piece spawns after the first can only be adjacent to existing hexboard
+ Implement some sort of system to keep track of piece positions etc
+ Apply actual game rules to the game
	+ Big one - start easy with Queen, then go out in difficulty
+ Add turns / Win condition etc...

Phase 5: Multiplayer
+ Sync the app up with firebase or some tool
+ Wire the game up for multiplayer
